# My `nmap` Tool

This repository contains the source code for my custom implementation of the `nmap` tool. This lightweight implementation focuses on port scanning and service detection, offering a basic feature set to identify open ports and running services on a target machine.

## Features

This implementation covers the following features/options:

- **Port Scanning**: Scans specified ports or all ports on a target machine.
- **Service Detection**: Identifies common services running on open ports (for the first 100 ports).
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows customization of port ranges for scanning.
- **DNS and IP Support**: Supports both numerical IP addresses and DNS names.

## Getting Started

To get started with this `nmap` implementation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nmap.git
cd nmap
```

## Usage Examples

### Options

| Option    | Shorthand | Description                               | Required |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `--ports` | `-p`      | Specify port range or `-p-` for all ports | x        |
| `-s`      | -         | Target IP address or DNS name             | x        |

### Scanning Ports

To scan specific ports or all ports on a target machine, use the following commands:

#### Scan Specific Port Range

```shell
python nmap.py -s <target> -p <port_range>
```

- `target`: The IP address or DNS name of the target machine.
- `port_range`: The range of ports to scan (e.g., `22,80,443` or `1-1000`).

Example:

```shell
python nmap.py -s 10.0.2.41 -p 22,80,443
```

#### Scan all Ports

```shell
python nmap.py -s <target> -p-
```

- `target`: The IP address or DNS name of the target machine.

Example:

```shell
python nmap.py -s 10.0.2.41 -p-
```

### Service Detection

For the first 100 ports, the tool will also attempt to identify the running services.

## Creating DNS Name

To use a DNS name like `yourtarget.abc` instead of an IP address, you need to add this name to your system's `hosts` file. This file maps hostnames to IP addresses.

### On Windows

1. **Open the `hosts` File as Administrator**:

- Search for Notepad in the Windows search bar.
- Right-click on Notepad and select Run as administrator.
- In Notepad, go to **File** > **Open** and navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
- Ensure the file type is set to **All Files** to see the `hosts` file.

2. **Add the DNS Entry**:

```shell
<IP_ADDRESS>    yourtarget.abc
```

- Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the actual IP address of your target machine.
- Save and close the file.

### On Linux/MacOS

1. **Open the `hosts` File with Root Permissions**:

- Open a terminal.
- Use the following command to edit the file with a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

or

```shell
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

2. **Add the DNS Entry**:

```shell
<IP_ADDRESS>    yourtarget.abc
```

- Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the actual IP address of your target machine.
  Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl+X` then `Y` for `nano`, or `:wq` for `vi`).
